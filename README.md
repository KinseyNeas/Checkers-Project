In this project, we have created a simple AI that can determine the next best move on a Checkers board. 



In order to compile the program run 'make' on the command line. 

After compiling you can include one of these tags following the command: ./play

Checkers [options] [file]
 
   -w    OR     --winner      : Print out the best move.
 
   -d <num> OR  --depth <num> : Use <num> as a cutoff depth.
 
   -h    OR     --help        : Print out help message and quit the program.
 
   -m <move> OR --move <move> : Make a <move> and print out the resulting board.
 
   -v    OR     --verbose     : Output the move and a description of how good it is.
